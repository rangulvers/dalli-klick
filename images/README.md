# Adding Test Images

To test the Dalli-Klick game, you'll need to add some images to play with.

## Quick Setup

1. Create a folder anywhere on your computer (e.g., `~/Pictures/dalli-klick-test`)

2. Add images to this folder:
   - Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF
   - Any resolution works (the app scales automatically)
   - Recommended: 5-20 images for a good party round

3. When you launch the app, click "Select Folder" and choose your image folder

## Sample Image Sources

You can use:
- Photos from your camera roll
- Downloaded images from the internet
- Screenshots from movies/TV shows
- Famous landmarks or monuments
- Product logos or brand images
- Artworks or paintings
- Sports team logos

## Tips for Good Game Images

- **Clear subjects**: Images with a single, recognizable object work best
- **Variety**: Mix easy and difficult images for balanced gameplay
- **Context clues**: Images with surrounding context are more fun to guess progressively
- **High contrast**: Images with distinct shapes and colors reveal better through hexagons
- **Avoid text-heavy images**: Pure text is too easy once a few letters appear

## Example Image Ideas

1. Eiffel Tower
2. Golden Gate Bridge
3. Famous movie characters
4. Car brands/models
5. Food dishes
6. Musical instruments
7. Famous paintings
8. Animals in nature
9. Sports stadiums
10. Iconic buildings

Have fun playing!
